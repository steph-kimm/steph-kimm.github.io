                This was the first time I ever used html and css.
                My class and I made a SAMS-tagram and added false 
                comments from people. The resume was for Andrew Carnegie,
                the founder of Carnegie Mellon University. Above is 
                the photo of the resume.

                In this, you can enter the image adress
                to any picture you want and it will add the image to
                the page. This is meant for you to be able to crete your 
                own Moodboard.

            <p>
              This is actually a game. In this game, random words
              pop up every three seconds and you need to type the words
              that pop up at the top to make them disapear.

              This is like the other SAMS-tagram except you can
              make your own posts and profile! You can post,
              set a profile pic, and make a bio.

          <p>
            In here, you can make a list of things you need to
            do in the form of sticky notes! When you're done with 
            a task, you just click on the note and it'll
            disapear.

        At my internship at the American Museum of Natural History,
        we used python to explore different areas of science
        including paleo-neuroscience, astro physics, and more.
        My favorite project I worked on by far was a paleo neuro 
        project where we used machine learning to make
        the computer differentiate between a bird brain and dinosaur 
        brain. Th photo above is one of the trees that I generated.
