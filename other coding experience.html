            I volunteer at Mount Sinai St.Lukes hospital
            one to two times a week. I started my application 
            to volunteer the second that I turned 16 and I 
            was ready to do everything I needed there.
            We assist the patients in ways that we can, and
            we try to help out their families as well. When
            you're a volunteer for long enough, you're even 
            asked to train the new volunteers.

            37 students from the NYC high school area take place
            in this mentorship a year. We are provided with
            medical student mentors to teach us about the process
            they went through and are continuing to go through to become
            doctors. One of the main things we do, my favorite activity there,
            is look at a real case that happened. We get the paitent's
            stats and symptoms, and we try to diagnose the paitent.

                  20 kids around New York City learn how to code through 
                  python while we apply it to real life situations. We 
                  also work with museum staff and help them with their 
                  research while learning a lot ourselves.
